Thursday, June 9th Reflection 

Please write some words and discuss; What were you hoping to get out of this internship program AND how do you think it’s going?

I didn’t really know much coming into this internship. All I knew was that I would be developing web applications using Ruby on Rails 
and a bit of CSS / HTML, so that’s what I was hoping I would get out of it. By the end of the summer, I’m hoping that I can get 
comfortable with Ruby on Rails and be confident that I can comfortably create a decently advanced web application on my own. 
I also wanted to learn more about programming in general and how real software developers think. 

As of right now, I do think I am learning a lot. I’m progressing well and gradually getting more and more comfortable with Ruby on Rails,
and I think I’m picking up little details about programming each day (whether it’s talking with Dave or reading the Apprenticeship Patterns book). 

Just wanted to preface this by saying that I completely understand that this is the first time W&ADS has participated in the ITS internship program 
(and I’m eternally grateful for Dave and the rest of the team for setting this up) so there’s bound to be some bumps in the road. However, 
I do believe there are some spots for improvement. I think it would be really great if we could have more sessions where we go through parts in the book
together (like that one session we had). Although I think the textbook is a great resource, I get the feeling that sometimes its written for people 
who already have extensive experience with programming, so it often overlooks things that I don’t have the background knowledge for. Ideally, I think 
it would be great if we could have one in person session dedicating to working through the assigned chapter in the beginning of the week (we read the 
chapter beforehand, of course) just so that we can work through any questions we had.
